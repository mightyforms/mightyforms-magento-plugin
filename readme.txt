Powerful web forms - made easy. Quickly create beautiful forms for any website with this intuitive Drag & Drop online form builder.

== Description ==

**What is MightyForms**

MightyForms is a powerful online form builder app that allows you to quickly build and truly customize a web form to serve your business’ needs. With a flexible, yet simple interface, you can create a form that reflects your brand, your message, and your values, so it can seamlessly be integrated into your website.

**What does MightyForms do:**

MightyForms makes building a complex web form into an easy and intuitive process. You can create your form from scratch or from dozens of professionally crafted templates. If you already have a form, either in PDF format or even another existing web form that you want to edit or update, you can easily upload it and work with the existing information.

If you want to keep the filled out forms in PDF format, MightyForms can automatically:
convert your PDF file form into a web form,
display it however you like for the end-user,
reconvert the submitted information back into PDF format for your convenience.

Whether you need to create contact forms, surveys, email subscription forms, job applications, order forms, payment forms, send emails, and so on - stand out with a form that matches your brand and gives your new subscriber the experience you know they deserve.

**Make it your mighty form**

Connect with your audience with a form that resonates with your brand. MightyForms has several tools to customize your form however you like. More than just choosing colors, field options and using drag-and-drop editors, MightyForms allows you to personalize the size, shape, and spacing of your form elements.

Bring in your own elements, add your exclusive images, include your company logo and even use an existing element from another existing web form or PDF form. You can also easily create a unique experience for the user by arranging logic rules, where the answers submitted determine the next values shown.

**Connect with MightyForms**

Build stronger relationships by creating a success page after the submission is complete. You can personalize it with a thank you message or take your new leads to a landing page. Don’t miss out on any leads by creating notifications every time there is a new sign up, you can send an e-mail or SMS message to yourself, another to your sales team, a submission receipt message to the new lead, and more!

Easily integrate your forms to important CMS, CRM or E-commerce systems through MightyForms plugins and extensions. You can also connect with over 1.500 apps through Zapier to make your form work for you, whatever your workflow.

**MightyForms and Google**

How can we talk about empowering your business in the online realm without talking about the big G? MightyForms makes your data collection a lot easier by making it possible for you to connect your Google Tags Manager or Google Analytics account for advanced analytics and even A/B testing through Google Optimize.
